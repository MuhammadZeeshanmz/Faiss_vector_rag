# Faiss_vector_rag

This project demonstrates how to use **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** for efficient similarity search in a vector-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setup.

## 🔍 What is FAISS?

FAISS is an open-source library developed by Facebook AI Research, designed to quickly search, cluster, and retrieve dense vectors. It is widely used in large-scale machine learning and NLP applications for tasks such as:

- Semantic search
- Document retrieval
- Recommendation systems
- Question answering with vector databases
